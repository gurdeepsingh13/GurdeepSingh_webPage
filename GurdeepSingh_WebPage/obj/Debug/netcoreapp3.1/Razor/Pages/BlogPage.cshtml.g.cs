        <h1>How small businesses have shifted to online sales</h1>
        <h5>It’s nowhere near as easy as just hitting a button, especially during a pandemic.</h5>

            You’d be forgiven for thinking that now, maybe more than ever, it’s easy to run a small business.
            That where there’s a will (and stable wifi), you can source, produce, and automate your way to residual income.
            It’s what my Instagram Explore page seemed to suggest one day, surfacing a Reel announcing the “sold-out launch” of something — you never see what — from someone who seemed optimized for the platform: excited for their own success, unburdened by the intensive labor it must’ve taken to get there.
        </p>

        <p>
            It amounts to an ad for a suite of integrated marketing tools for merchants on Instagram, a platform that I’ve");

            It has taken me, a millennial, years to wrap my head around the scope of this work — how to do it, then do it better, then realize my “creative class” ass has never taken a business course and can’t balance a checkbook.
            (Do people still balance checkbooks?) Global quarantine measures and the resulting surge in online sales might seem like a boon at first glance, but they present a host of additional challenges for small-business owners.

            The partners, including Etsy, Square, Shopify, and Clearbanc, offer perks such no fees (up to a certain amount), a free 90-day trial, and free listing credits, among others.
            Most of what they offer assistance with — branding, marketing, photography, SEO — is an entire department at any well-structured organization.
            The program assumes both digital literacy and technological access but doesn’t guarantee them. For the most part, migrating a");

        <p>Netflix started out as a tiny DVD-by-mail service in 1997, overlooked by Hollywood and almost everyone else.</p>
        <p>Now we’re all watching Netflix, all the time.</p>
        <p>With nearly 200 million subscribers around the world, Netflix owns t");
            WriteLiteral(@"he streaming business. But more than that: It’s increasingly defining what entertainment is and how we expect to consume it.</p>
        <p>The idea that we could hit a button and watch nearly anything we want, whenever we want, without an ad, seemed like a fantasy when Netflix first launched. Now it’s a given. And while other media companies like Disney have struggled during the pandemic, Netflix has thrived.</p>
        <p>So in this season of Vox Media’s Land of the Giants podcast series, we talk to the people who founded the company and the ones who run it today — as well as its competitors, critics, and creators. There’s a lot to talk about.</p>
        <p>
            We’ve gone back in time to find out how Netflix developed its prized and very strange corporate culture that eschews strict expense policies but also expects employees to tell their peers when they fail.
            We look at why Blockbuster should have vanquished Netflix but killed itself instead. We check out Netflix’s vaunted recommend");
            WriteLiteral(@"ation algorithm and wonder if it’s getting you the content you want or just the content Netflix makes.
            We explore the company’s complicated relationship with Hollywood, which used to ignore Netflix, then saw it as easy money, and is now racing to catch up. And we also ask what a Netflix world means for the people who make TV shows and movies and what all of that means for you.
        </p>
        <p>This is a business story and a tech story. And, most important, it’s a story about our culture, and how it’s being defined by a company that started out in Silicon Valley, moved to Hollywood, and now has its sights on the whole world.</p>
